## Steam Tinker Launch

[Steam tinker launch](https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch) is a wrapper tool for
custom launching steam apps.

We are using it to enable global `gamescope` settings within steam.

```sh
gamescope -f -W 2560 -H 1440 -w 2560 -h 1440 -r 144 --framerate-limit 144 --force-grab-cursor -- %command%
```
