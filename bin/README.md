# Binaries

A collection of binaries that I have already built (and tested working) on one machine.

Adding it to git because I have multiple machines, and I don't want to bother re-building again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Built for PopOS 22.04

The binaries are compressed. Use the command below to uncompress them.

```sh
tar -xvf {PROGRAM}.tar.xz
```

> [!TIP]
> `fuzzel`, `mako`, and `xwayland-satellite` reside in `/usr/local/bin/`.
