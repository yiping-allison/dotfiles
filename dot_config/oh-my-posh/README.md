## Oh My Posh Configs

> [!TIP]
> Reminder to self since I will eventually forget...
>
> The themes under this folder should be moved to `$HOME/system/oh-my-posh`. This is where `.zshrc` expects
> it to be.

> [!TIP]
> Also remember that the font is managed through `oh-my-posh` as well.
> See [docs](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/fonts).
